            Ulike’s 90-Day<br/>
            Money-Back Guarantee
          </div>
          <div class="return-after-sale-txt">
            At Ulike, your satisfaction is our top priority. That's why we are proud to offer a 90-day hair-free money-back guarantee when you purchase any Ulike IPL device. If, within 90 days of your purchase from our official website, you are not satisfied with the product or the results, you may return it for a refund.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To ensure a fair application of the return policy, we suggest users to follow the recommended usage stated in the manual for at least one month before submitting a return request. After about a month, users should see a noticeable reduction in hair growth. We also recommend extending your personal trial period to the full 90 days, as all individuals are different and it may take a longer period of time to see results from the IPL treatment. If the period of use is less than one month or the recommended usage stated in the manual is not followed, the return policy is considered void.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In addition, please note that IPL may not be effective for every individual depending on their hair color and skin tone. Therefore, we recommend that everyone review the suitability chart on our official website before purchasing. If you have any concerns or questions about IPL, our products, or anything else, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team at support@ulikeglobal.com.
